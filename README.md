# JDBC Project using Apache Maven

I am using the Build Tools called **Apache Maven** which allows me to make a connection to the PostgreSql Database

# Purpose of using this Tool

> Maven is primarily designed to automate the process of compiling, packaging, and distributing software projects. It defines a standard lifecycle for Java projects and provides plugins to perform specific tasks at different stages of that lifecycle.

# Declarative Configuration:

- In Maven, you configure your project through a file called **pom.xml (Project Object Model)**.

- This file contains information about the project, its dependencies, and how it should be built. Configuration is declarative, meaning you specify what you want to achieve and Maven takes care of the details.

# Java Frameworks vs. Build Tools:

In Java, **the word "framework"** often refers to development libraries or frameworks, such as **Spring Framework** or **Hibernate**. These provide frameworks for building applications. Maven, on the other hand, does not provide a development framework for application logic, but rather an approach to managing the build process.
